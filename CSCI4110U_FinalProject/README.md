-Part_1: It is the running robot simulation in a cave environment, press "w" "a" "s" "d" to change the perspective.

-Part_2: Is the skybox. We don't have enough combine our works together because of there is a lot issues when combining, such as the character no showing up in the skybox.
         -move the camera with the mouse
Extra Notes:
-Used primitives for the Humanoid walking, needed to hard code texture coordinates to apply textures to the humanoid walking.  
-Primitives could not be drawn ocer the skybox.
-were able to apply normals to the primitives. and ambient.
